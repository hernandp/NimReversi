# NimReversi

A console-based Reversi game written in Nim. Just for fun.

## Requeriments

Just compile with Nim compiler C backend. Any version >0.19.0 should work. Also, portability between common platforms shall not pose any problem.

```
nim c reversi.nim
```

* Use `--cc:vcc` to compile using Microsoft compilers. 
* Use `-d:release` to generate an optimized build.

## How to play

There are three modes available: One Player (vs CPU), Two Players and CPU vs CPU.
