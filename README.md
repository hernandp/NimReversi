## Requeriments

Just compile with Nim compiler C backend. Any version >0.19.0 should work. Also, portability between common platforms shall not pose any problem.

```
nim c reversi.nim
```

* Use `--cc:vcc` to compile using Microsoft compilers. 
* Use `-d:release` to generate an optimized build.

## How to play

There are three modes available: One Player (vs CPU), Two Players and CPU vs CPU. 
Control cursor with A W S D keys, and press ENTER to place discs.

## Details

The computer AI will filter all but the best positions, that is, where the maximum number of rival discs can be overthrown/reversed. Subsequently, it will randomly select one of the top-scored cells. The "THINKING" animated label just simulates a deep AI.  Actually, it's completely dumb. But Reversi is known for being a hard game in terms of planning , even this dumb AI can be challenging.  According to Wikipedia, 

>> This is mostly due to difficulties in human look-ahead peculiar to Othello: The interchangeability of the disks and therefore apparent strategic meaninglessness (as opposed to chess pieces for example) makes an evaluation of different moves much harder.
